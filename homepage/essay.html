          <p>I can't quite remember the first time I was in the echo tunnel. I was probably a baby strapped to my parents chest.
            Perhaps my two year old sister was there too. One thing I know for certain is that my dad would have been shouting,
            “echo, echo.” And the voice of the tunnel would have shouted it back.</p>
         <p>We came back again and again. Maybe because the park was so close to our house. Maybe we were walking out of the
          farmers market at Grand Army Plaza on a Sunday morning in fall. In one hand, my dad would carry the half gallon of
          apple cider we just bought. In the other, a jacket that me or my sister refused to wear. We would walk through the stone gate out of the plaza, through the piles of yellow leaves, and onto the shaded hexagonal stones of the pathway. I can still smell the aroma of apples mixed with the stench of ginko. We would walk along this path until we reached the echo tunnel. The bright foliage would fade away and soon the dappled autumn light could hardly be seen. All that would be left was the spot of light from the end of the tunnel, a slight scent of mildew, and near total darkness.
          <p>The echo tunnel was certainly designed to be a beautiful structure. The stone arches and carvings are straight out of another time period, and they certainly have a charm to them. But the eerie feeling that the tunnel emanates is also hard to ignore. How can one place be so lovely yet so unnerving?</p>
          <p>I think it has something to do with the fact that the beauty is hidden from the moment you lay eyes on the tunnel. Ivy has grown over the entrance, almost as if you were never meant to find the tunnel in the first place. Like any floor in New York, the tiles here will never be clean. They lay buried under decades of grime and litter. It is dark. So dark that whatever extreme care was taken to details at the time of construction now sometimes seems pointless.
          What's more, lining the walls are two benches, custom built just for this location. They stretch the entire, fairly long distance from end to end of the tunnel. Their wooden slats are perfectly molded to fit the curvature of the walls. I can imagine carpenters meticulously measuring, cutting, hammering. It must have taken ages. But now there they sit, the slats half ripped out and sticking up, daring to stab anyone who takes a moment to rest. Pools of murky water, or maybe some other unidentified liquid, collect in the dips of the seat.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, despite the weathered wood, grimy stone, and water trickling down the walls into puddles on the floor, the structure has remained the same. Looking at the majestic arch and intricate carvings, I find it easy to imagine the generations before me standing in the exact same spot. I can picture ladies of the 1800s strolling through, pushing carriages or holding the hands of their small children just as my dad held mine. This tunnel has seen Brooklyn transform. It has watched in winters as wooden sleds morphed into cheap orange plastic ones over the centuries. It has heard as the clip clop of horses on Prospect Park West turned into the clatter of brand new model Ts and eventually faded to the steady hum of a subaru or tesla. Skyscrapers and highrises have shot up all around. Yet the echo tunnel stands firm, beckoning each passerby with its old charm. It struck me as a toddler with its grand arches inviting me in. Over time, the tunnel watched as I grew from a tiny second grader, skipping as I held hands with my dad, into who I am today.
            <p>However each time I pass through, I slow just a bit. Whatever is on my mind fades as the echo of my footsteps against stone ricochets off the curved walls. The hurry I am in becomes unimportant for a moment, and I am able to take a rare deep breath. Each time I leave just slightly more at peace, and reassured in knowing that I may return whenever I am in need of solitude and comfort, just as thousands of others have. It will always provide each and every New Yorker with a unique sense of stability, just as it has done for me.</p>
